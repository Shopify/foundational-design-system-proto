Design tokens are design decisions that enable unified and cohesive product experiences.

## Principles

### Scale design decisions

We believe that by documenting our design decisions, we can up-level design quality and encourage cohesion over sameness. To do this, every design decision needs guidance on what problems they are solving and when to apply them.

### Platform agnostic

We believe that people should have a high quality experience that scales across platforms. People work across many different products and often need to context switch. To ensure a cohesive quality experience across devices, consider scale, legibility of type, and UI interactions.

### Cohesive

We believe in creating a sense of cohesion through a shared set of foundational values. Audiences and their unique contexts impact the decisions we make. We recognize that certain audiences have different needs. We need to provide our users with a flexible foundation that enables them to solve audience specific problems while keeping a sense of cohesion across Shopify experiences.
